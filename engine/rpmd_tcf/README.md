## RPMD Time-Correlation Functions
---
Simple starter program for plotting classical and RPMD centroid position auto-correlation functions:

- classical_tcf.py: Code to produce classical TCFs for a given external potential
- tcf_funcs.py: Functions for both files
- rpmd_tcf.py: Code to produce RPMD TCFs
